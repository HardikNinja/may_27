	FUNCTIONAL INTERFACES Defi ==> Functional interfaces are interfaces that ensure that they include only one abstract method.

	::Lamda Expression 	(This is only possible with Functional Interface) ->  :: 	method () -> method definition
	::stream 			[A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations]

Since Java SE 1.8 onwards, there are many interfaces that are converted into functional interface. 
All these interfaces are annotated with @FunctionalInterface. These interfaces are as follows – 

		Runnable		–> This interface only contains the run() method.
		Comparable 		–> This interface only contains the compareTo() method.
		ActionListener 	–> This interface only contains the actionPerformed() method.
		Callable 		–> This interface only contains the call() method.

Q. 	What is Advantages of lamda expression?
A.	Advantages
		1. Avoid writing anonymous impl
		2. it saves lot of code
		3. The code is directly readable without interpretation.
	DisAdvantages
		1. Hard to use without IDE
		2. Complex to Debug

A.		1.	filter,
		2.	forEaach
		3.	sorted
